##
Personal repo for hosting files to successfully build Chromium 87 on Linux, or Windows.

M87 was the last "classic" Chromium, with support for flash, NaCl, no MV3 support, and last to be able to be built on Windows 7.

Has a few patches and optimizations backported from [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/).
